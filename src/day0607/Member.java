/**

 *
 * An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.
 *
 * A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
 *
 * In OOP, we create objects to solve complex problems.
 *
 * state and behavior
 *   - An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages)
 *   - and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages)
 *
 * You may also occasionally see the term "member" used as well. A type's fields, methods, and nested types are collectively called its members.
